# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
The JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification taught me basic JavaScript in a series of challenges.

I built the following programs :

* Palindrome Checker
* Roman Numeral Converter
* Caesars Cipher
* Telephone Number Validator
* Cash Register
